# CoderDojo Mobile Toolbox

The CoderDojo Mobile Toolbox is a web application that supports / simplifies / enriches you CoderDojo sessions.

By installing it on a Raspberry Pi configured as a wireless hotspot, you'll have a completely stand-alone, portable solution: Ninjas can use the web app even where there is no existing wireless networks. 

Currently the application is in an early development stage, but it has already been used in real CoderDojo sessions with 15+ participants.

## Current features

- Tutorial repository with resources (e.g. sprites, sounds)
- Sprite gallery
- Software repository (e.g. Scratch installer) 
- Event Management
