Learning Material
=====================

The toolbox was first created as a way to distribute learning material to Ninjas during CoderDojo session.

Learning material is grouped by topic. So the first step is creating one or more ``Topics``. You'll need to provide a screenshot so that the topic can be represented graphically.

Once you have created a topic, you can go on creating ``Learning Material``. A single ``Learning Material`` is characterized by a title, a description, a tutorial that is only accessible to Mentors, and one or more downloadable resources that can be downloaded by Ninjas. It's also characterized by a difficulty level. Currently only 3 levels are supported: ``1: Beginner, 2: Intermediate, 3 Advanced``.
There is also an ``is active`` flag that can be used to hide the learning material if you need, for any reason.
